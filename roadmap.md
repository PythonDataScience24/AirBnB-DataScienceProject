# General Project Guidelines

- Include a **members.txt** with the group members names.
- Do not use Jupyter Notebooks. Write code in python scripts that can run in the
terminal.
- Include a **requirements.txt** file with the package requirements of your project.
- For every submission, include an updated README file.
- A naive user must be able to execute your scripts without checking the code.
- If relevant, database/table(s) necessary to test the project must be included in
the submission.
