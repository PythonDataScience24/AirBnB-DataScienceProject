# Our Project (what are we doing)
It's Holiday Time! But wait, we still need to find a suitable and cheap acommodation. Where should we start?
If that is your question, our AirBNB reporting and analysis Tool can help you. 
In our App we try to provide you all relevant Information you need to have to find the best and suitavle accommadation on AirBNB for your next holidays.
How we try to achieve this goal
- Our App let's you explore informations about prices, availabilities and ratings.
- Select a Neighbourhood and check Information about costs, special room offers or room availabilities on AirBNB for the specified Neighboorhood.  
- You select, which Information you want to have visuallized.
- Compare ratings and be sure the accomodation holds what it promises
# Our Goal and vision
Our goal is to make your travel planning easier.
Our overall goal is to create a user-friendly reporting tool that allows user-specific analysis of AirBnB accommodation. 

# Who we are
We would like to introduce ourself shortly. We are Viola Meier, Romano Brentani, Lukas KÃ¼nzi, Barbara Dravec, four students graduating their Bachelors degree in Computer Science at the university of Bern Switzerland. You find more Informations of us in the members File. 
The application is being developed as a part of the Bachelor's programm "Programing for Datascience", lectured by the University of Bern, which all four Students visit. 


# What makes our Project special 
The project uses a rich data set from Kaggel that contains extensive details about the AirBnBs. 
The project emphasises interactive features. Users can analyse the data using parameters of their choice. For example, the AirBnB data can be analysed by city, neighbourhood or room type.
An additional advantage of the reporting tool is the clear visualisation of the data, which makes the analysis understandable and intuitive.
