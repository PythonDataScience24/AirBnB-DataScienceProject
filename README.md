# Analyse AirBnB - a reporting tool for AirBnB accommodations
# Welcome
Welcome to our AriBnB reporting and analysis plattform! Great to have you here!
With this short documentation we would like to give you some basic information about the goal of the app and why you should use it. So, let's get started.

# Our project (what are we doing)
It's holiday season! But wait, we still need to find a suitable and cheap accommodation. Where should we start?
If this is your question, our AirBnB reporting and analysis tool can help you right away. 
In our app we try to provide you all relevant information you need to have to find the best and suitable accommadation on AirBnB for your next Holidays.
How we try to achieve this goal
- Our app allows you to explore information about accommodations on AirBnB like prices, availabilities or ratings.
- The App gives you the possibility to select a neighbourhood and to check information about costs, room offers or room availabilities on AirBnB for the specified neighboorhood.  
- You select, which information you want to have visualized.
- Compare ratings and be sure the accomodation holds what it promises.

# Our goal and vision
We know how hard and time intense it can be to find the right place to spend your holidays. Our goal is to make your life easier when it comes to your holidays. With a user friendly tool we want to achieve that everybody can find their favorite and the most suitable accommodation according to their needs. It should not matter if you are looking for the cheapest or most expensive one, with our tool you should be able to find whatever your are looking for. 

# Who we are
We would like to introduce ourself shortly. We are Viola Meier, Romano Brentani, Lukas Künzi, Barbara Dravec, four students currently doing their Bachelors degree in Computer Science at the University of Berne, Switzerland. You find more information about us in the members file. 
This application is being developed by our team within the Bachelor's program "Programming for Datascience" at University of Berne. 

# What makes our project special 
The project uses a rich dataset from Kaggel that contains extensive details about AirBnB's listings. 
The project emphasises interactive features. Users can analyse the data using parameters of their choice. For example, the AirBnB data can be analysed by city, neighbourhood or room type.
An additional advantage of the reporting tool is the clear visualisation of the data, which makes the analysis understandable and intuitive.
