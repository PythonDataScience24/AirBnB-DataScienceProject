# Who we are

# What makes our Project special 
The project uses a rich data set from Kaggel that contains extensive details about the AirBnBs. 
The project emphasises interactive features. Users can analyse the data using parameters of their choice. For example, the AirBnB data can be analysed by city, neighbourhood or room type.
An additional advantage of the reporting tool is the clear visualisation of the data, which makes the analysis understandable and intuitive.
