# Analyse AirBnB - a reporting and analysis tool for AirBnb - Roadmap
## Welcome dear traveler! 
We are a team of students from the University of Bern.
Our vision for this project is to help all travelers to find the best accommodation for their needs.
We want to provide a tool that allows users to explore the data, select the best accommodation for their needs and visualize the data in a way that is easy to understand.
Our project is special because we are using the Airbnb dataset, which provides unique insights into the accommodation market. [Learn more](README.md)
